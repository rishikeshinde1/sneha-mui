                    <h3>Reality Of Refined Oils</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here we would like to bring you to this fact. All the refined and
                        double refined oils are processed using 6-7 chemicals in oil
                        factories. When filtration process is done on cooking oils, it
                        looses good cholesterol (HDL) from it and only remains is bad
                        cholesterol (LDL) in oils. These oils are most dangerous for our
                        health. It imbalances “Vaata” of our body and leads to the serious
                        diseases like heart attack.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There is a misconception these days that using unfiltered oils are
                        not recommended. However fact is completely different! Ayurveda
                        recommends to use unfiltered and unrefined oils only. So correct
                        your misconception and start using unfiltered raw oils today which
                        are full of nutrients.
