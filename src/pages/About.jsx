            <h2>SNEH-SATTAVA COLD PRESSED OIL</h2>

            <p>
                The team at Snehsattva Oils is immensely focused on bringing
                food which our ancestors consumed for thousands of years and

                innovative manufacturing processes and quality management”. We
                want to push people towards healthy food choices. We decided to
                begin with the most basic and indispensable ingredient of Indian
                cooking – edible oils.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our oils are made from the finest quality food grade seeds
                sourced from farms in Allover India. We take utmost care to
                preserve their true nutrition, flavor, and aroma.

            <p>
                This land has a great legacy of thousands of years of culture,
                traditions, research and science. Our ancestors shared their
                wisdom with us through various scriptures, be it Yoga, Ayurved,
                Rasayanshastra and many other ancient scriptures. Be it food we
                eat, Exercise we do, clothes we wear or fragrances we smell,
                this land had discovered ways of enjoying life and staying
                healthy and happy by staying in harmony with nature.
            </p>

            <p>
                We firmly believe that all we have to do to be happy and healthy
                is to connect with our own roots. Just eliminate harmful toxic
                chemicals from our life, eat better quality of food and adopt a
                lifestyle in harmony with nature.
            </p>

            <p>
                This thought encouraged us to build an ecosystem that provides a
                platform for manufacture, sell or look for authentic
                traditionally made Indian things.
